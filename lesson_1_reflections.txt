How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to focus on what is important

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Find bugs more quickly. Revert back to something that worked better. Test
    often new things

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: more thoughtful process where each commit is meaningful
    Cons: we can forget to do the commit!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A program may need multiple files that have changed, it is fundamentally
    different from Google Docs where each file is conceptually different

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the commits, git diff shows the differences between two
    commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I could revert back more easily if it's broken and debug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My lambda functions, and everything else !

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily track different projects. Memory is going to be saturated
    without help!
