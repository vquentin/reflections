What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates a .git folder where git stores the metadata

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    working directory is a snapshot of all files linked to a commit. The
    repository contains all changes ever made, the staging area is intermediate
    between the working directory and the commit. Value offered? Helps breaking
    down commit in large projects?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    only add the files related to the logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    When the code can go in significantly different directions. Or when
    developing new features. Could have master branch being production code,
    One branch for development, one for testing.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    It's useful because it helps to see what happened a long time ago, or for
    complex projects with multiple people contributing. Could it also help
    recover an unreachable commit? Not sure!

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    A total mess that does not work as intended. I am giving up!

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
